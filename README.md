### The Citician
__Description__: "The Citician" is an Android Game that I developed. In this game, people are shown a random picture of a city, and they guess the city. <br>
The game entertains people as well as it educates them, by showing them hundreds of pictures around the globe.<br>
More than 1000 cities in the database 
<br>
%100 Online
<br>
__Systems Used__: 
+ __Firebase Realtime Database__ <br>
  All the questions(cities) are stored in the Firebase realtime database. When the app launches, the algorithm fetches all the questions from online database to the application. 
+ __Firebase Storage__ <br>
  All the images are stored in the cloud in the Firebase Storage servers
+ __Picasso Library__<br>
  The cities are shown to the user from an URL, No image is stored in the device.
